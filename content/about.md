Jerkins, are you getting this all down? Quiet man, I'd hate for anything to be missed, and don't mumble.

Right then: It is my hope to share with the Great British Public a great many sketches of life here in our fair capital.
From gin days in our many grand parks to, yes more gin, nights in electric Soho, I intend to document them all! For science, of course. No I don't think it's too much gin, keep writing.

Swept up with me on my many adventurers will be a cadre of irregulars and reprobates drawn from my excellent colleagues, friends, and acquaintances.

Right, that should do, Jerkins! Pop the kettle on, and ready the wine for this evening. Yes, all of it.
