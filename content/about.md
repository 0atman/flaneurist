Jerkins, are you getting this all down? Quiet man, I'd hate for anything to be missed, and don't mumble.

The preface should be entitled _*How I Did It, Without Doing Anything Really*_. That'll catch them!
Or maybe it won't, I'll think of something better later...

Right then. It is my hope to share with the Great British Public slices of life here in our fair capital.
From gin days in our many grand parks to, yes more gin, nights in electric Soho, I intend to document them all! For science, of course.

Caught up with me on my many adventurers will be a cadre of irregulars drawn from my excellent colleagues, friends, and acquaintances.

Right, that should do, Jerkins! Pop the kettle on, and ready the wine for this evening. Yes, all of it.
